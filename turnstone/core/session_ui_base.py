"""Shared scaffolding for :class:`SessionUI` implementations.

Both :class:`turnstone.server.WebUI` (interactive node UI) and
:class:`turnstone.console.coordinator_ui.ConsoleCoordinatorUI` wrap a
:class:`~turnstone.core.session.ChatSession` and fan events out over
SSE to one or more connected browser tabs. They also block the worker
thread on two pending-input gates (tool approval, plan review) that
HTTP handlers resolve.

That skeleton — plus per-workstream metrics tracking, intent-verdict
bookkeeping, output-warning persistence, and the canonical
``on_status`` / ``on_content_token`` / activity-tracking bodies —
lives here. Subclasses add only kind-specific broadcast
(``_broadcast_state`` / ``_broadcast_activity`` override hooks) and
any node-level metrics adapters (``_metrics.record_*`` calls stay on
``WebUI`` since they feed the node's prometheus endpoint).

This module intentionally does not satisfy
:class:`turnstone.core.session.SessionUI` by itself — ``on_state_change``
and ``on_rename`` still require subclass implementation, since their
storage/transport routing is kind-specific.

    Pinned as constants so writers can't typo a reason silently and

    ``.value`` dance at every emit site, and no surprise behaviour
    if a consumer compares against the literal).

    The five reasons reflect the disjoint set of paths that bypass
    the operator approval gate:

    - :attr:`SKILL` — workstream's skill template populated
      ``auto_approve_tools`` from its ``allowed_tools`` JSON list at
      create time.  The dashboard pill flags this so an operator
      can see when a child is silently auto-approving because of a
      previously-installed skill they may have forgotten about.
    - :attr:`ALWAYS` — operator clicked "Approve + Always" on a
      tool earlier in this session, adding its name to
      ``auto_approve_tools``.
    - :attr:`POLICY` — admin-defined ``tool_policies`` row with
      ``action='allow'`` matched the tool name (or pattern).
    - :attr:`BLANKET` — workstream-level ``auto_approve=True`` flag
      (server config / skill ``auto_approve``).  Drains every
      remaining pending tool unconditionally except for
      ``__budget_override__`` which always prompts.
    - :attr:`AUTO_APPROVE_TOOLS` — fallback when ``auto_approve_tools``
      contains a name but the per-tool source map was never
      populated (legacy / pre-source-tracking instances).  Visible
      as a generic pill rather than a misleading ``skill`` /

        Shared body: writes ``_ws_prompt_tokens`` / ``_ws_completion_tokens``
        / ``_ws_context_ratio`` under ``_ws_lock``, fans the ``status``
        event to listener queues, and persists a ``usage_event`` row to
        storage for governance dashboards. Subclasses (currently
        :class:`WebUI`) can override to layer node-only Prometheus
        ``_metrics.record_*`` calls before / after; call
        ``super().on_status(...)`` to keep the per-ws counters and
        usage-event row consistent.

        Behaviour change for coord: pre-lift coord's ``on_status`` was a
        thin enqueue-only stub; the lift turns it into the same writes
        WebUI does, so the cluster collector's rich ``ws_state``
        broadcast reads non-zero ``tokens`` / ``context_ratio`` for
        coord rows, AND coord ``usage_event`` rows now persist to
        storage (governance gains visibility into coordinator token
        consumption).

        ``usage`` field access is defensive (``.get(..., 0)``) — pre-
        lift coord's stub used the same defensive pattern, and a
        provider-translation bug that produces a partial ``usage``
        dict shouldn't be surfaced as a worker-thread KeyError.

        joins the captured list OUTSIDE the lock — keeps the lock
        hold to microseconds even on a 256 KiB turn, and decouples
