"""Shared HTTP route registrar for workstream-shaped sessions.

Both node and console processes mount the workstream HTTP tree at
``/v1/api/workstreams/`` via this registrar against their own
:class:`~turnstone.core.session_manager.SessionManager` (interactive
on the node, coordinator on the console). One URL shape, two
processes, kind-specific policy in :class:`SessionEndpointConfig`
captured by closure when the handler factory is called at app
construction.

Three registrar functions:

- :func:`register_session_routes` — verbs both kinds expose
  (``new``, ``close``, ``open``, ``delete``, ``send``, ``approve``,
  ``cancel``, ``events``, ``history``, ``detail``, ...).
  All handlers in :class:`SharedSessionVerbHandlers` are optional;
  ``None`` skips the route, so one bundle describes either kind.
- :func:`register_coord_verbs` — coord-only verbs (``trust``,
  ``restrict``, ``stop_cascade``, ``close_all_children``,
  ``children``, ``tasks``, ``metrics``) that read or mutate state
  that doesn't exist on interactive workstreams.

Some verbs in :class:`SharedSessionVerbHandlers` ship as factory-
returned closures (e.g. :func:`make_approve_handler`,
:func:`make_close_handler`) that bake their
:class:`SessionEndpointConfig` (and any verb-specific args like
``audit_emit``) in at app-construction time. Both node and console
call the factory during startup and pass the result as
``handlers.approve`` / ``handlers.close``.

    captures it via closure. The request-time handler reads ``cfg``
    from the closure rather than ``app.state`` so the dependency is
    visible at the wire-up site.

    - ``permission_gate``: kind's pre-handler permission check
      (e.g. ``admin.coordinator`` for coord, ``None`` for interactive
      which has no per-handler scope check beyond auth middleware).
      Returns the rejection response when the gate fails, ``None``
      when the request passes.
    - ``manager_lookup``: returns ``(SessionManager, None)`` when the
      kind's manager is loaded, or ``(None, JSONResponse)`` with a
      503 when the subsystem isn't available (coord on a console
      without configured models). For interactive the lookup just
      returns ``(app.state.workstreams, None)``.
    - ``tenant_check``: per-``ws_id`` existence + access gate.
      Interactive wires :func:`_require_ws_access` (which 404s when
      the workstream doesn't exist; row-level ownership is NOT
      enforced — turnstone is a trusted-team tool, ``admin.workstreams``
      scope is the cluster-wide gate). Coord sets this to ``None``
      and relies on ``admin.coordinator`` from ``permission_gate``
      plus an in-memory ``coord_mgr`` lookup at handler time.
      Always invoked via ``await asyncio.to_thread(...)`` at handler
      sites: the interactive resolver short-circuits on
      ``mgr.get(ws_id)`` for warm cache but falls through to a
      synchronous storage read (:func:`get_workstream_owner`) on a
      manager-cache miss, so offloading keeps the event loop free
      during cold-cache lookups.
    - ``not_found_label``: the message body for the 404 returned when
      the manager has no such ws_id ("Workstream not found" for
      interactive; "coordinator not found" for coord).
    - ``audit_action_prefix``: the dot-namespaced prefix the kind
      uses for its audit actions ("workstream" → ``workstream.cancel``;
      "coordinator" → ``coordinator.cancel``).

    Capability flags (added with the P1.5 ``send`` body lift):

    - ``supports_attachments``: when ``True``, the lifted ``send``
      handler resolves attachment_ids, reserves under a send_id token,
      and threads them through ``ChatSession.send`` /
      ``ChatSession.queue_message``. Both kinds wire ``True`` post-P1.5
      (the storage layer was always kind-agnostic; the gate stays
      around so a kind that hasn't lit up its UI surface yet can
      defer the verb body changes).
    - ``attachment_owner_resolver``: resolves the ``user_id`` to scope
      attachments under for a given request + ws_id. Required when
      ``supports_attachments`` is ``True``.
    - ``spawn_metrics``: optional bookkeeping hook fired once per
      ``send`` that spawns a fresh worker (queue-reuse path skips it).
      Interactive wires its WebUI per-conversation counters; coord
      wires ``None``.
    - ``emit_message_queued``: when ``True`` and the dispatcher takes
      the live-worker enqueue path, the lifted body emits a
      ``message_queued`` event onto the workstream's listener queue
      via ``ui._enqueue``. Both kinds wire ``True`` since both UIs

    sequence; per-kind divergence is in the audit detail shape and
    whether a request body ``reason`` is read / capped / persisted on
    the workstream's config row.

    Args:
        cfg: per-kind policy bundle (auth, manager lookup, tenant
            check, error labels). Captured by closure so the request-
            time handler doesn't reach into ``app.state``.
        audit_emit: kind's audit emitter for the close event.
            Receives ``(request, ws_id, ws_before, reason)``; ``reason``
            is the empty string when ``supports_close_reason`` is
            ``False`` or no reason was provided. ``None`` skips the
            audit entirely (only valid when neither kind cares).
        supports_close_reason: when ``True``, the handler reads a
            ``reason`` field from the JSON body, caps it at 512 UTF-8
            bytes, redacts credentials, persists it via
            ``storage.save_workstream_config(ws_id, {"close_reason": ...})``,

            ``workstream_config`` from unbounded growth on a model-
            generated dump; the redact protects audit logs from
            captured-secret leakage under prompt injection.

    Behavior change vs the pre-lift handlers:

    - The interactive handler previously let ``record_audit`` failures
      surface as HTTP 500 (no try/except). The lifted body wraps
      ``audit_emit`` in try/except and demotes failures to a
      ``warning`` log, returning 200 to the caller. Coord previously
      already swallowed; convergence is intentional — operators
      monitor the audit-fail log line in both kinds the same way.
    - The coord ``mgr.close()`` race-loss returned 500; standardized
      to 404 ("popped between ``.get()`` and ``.close()``" is a
      not-found semantic, not a server error).

        audit_emit: kind's audit emitter for the cancel event.
            ``None`` skips the audit entirely.

    Behavior changes vs the pre-lift handlers:

    - **Coord gains the ``force`` flag.** Pre-lift coord ignored
      ``force``; the lifted body honours it on both kinds (parity
      gain — coord workers can hang the same way interactive's can,
      and operators benefit from the same recovery path).
    - **Coord response shape now includes ``dropped: {}``.**
      Pre-lift coord returned bare ``{"status": "ok"}``; the unified
      shape always carries ``dropped`` so SDK consumers don't have
      to branch on kind. Coord's ``dropped`` is ``{}`` until coord
      grows its own forensic capture.
    - **Coord cancel returns 400 when ``ws.session is None``** (the
      placeholder/build-failed path). Pre-lift coord called
      ``coord_mgr.cancel`` which silently no-op'd on a placeholder;
      the lifted body 400s for parity with interactive's existing
      "No session" branch.
    - **Interactive ``resolve_plan`` now runs on every cancel** (was
      gated on ``was_running``). Lifts coord's always-resolve
      behaviour onto interactive — a stuck plan-pending state from
      a crashed worker thread can now be cleared via ``cancel``,
      matching coord's pre-lift recovery path. ``resolve_plan`` has
      its own internal ``_pending_plan_review is None`` guard, so
      the call is genuinely no-op when nothing is blocked.
      ``resolve_approval`` is **gated on ``ui._pending_approval is not None``**
      because :meth:`SessionUIBase.resolve_approval` is *not*
      idempotent — it always broadcasts ``approval_resolved`` and
      overwrites ``_approval_result``. Without the gate, every idle
      cancel would leak a stale resolution event to SSE listeners.
      The gate preserves the recovery semantics for the genuine
      stuck case while skipping the broadcast on idle cancels.

    → 404-on-miss sequence; per-kind divergence captured by the

      can pass user-friendly aliases ("my-debug-ws") in the path
      param. Coord wires ``None`` (hex ids only).

      events (``clear_ui`` + history) plus a handler-side
      ``ws_created`` enqueue onto the global SSE queue. Coord wires
      ``None`` and relies on the cluster collector fan-out triggered
      by ``CoordinatorAdapter.emit_rehydrated``.
    - ``audit_emit`` — kind's audit hook for the ``open`` event.

    reachable on interactive (it had been dead-by-routing pre-lift)

    """Lifted body for ``GET {prefix}/{ws_id}/events`` — per-workstream SSE.

    Both kinds share the SSE plumbing: register the per-UI listener
    queue, run the kind-specific initial replay (``cfg.events_replay``,
    typically ``connected`` + ``status`` + ``history`` + pending
    approval / plan on interactive; just pending approval / plan on
    coord), then drain the queue forever until either the workstream
    closes (``ws_closed`` event) or the client disconnects.

    The kind-specific divergence is captured entirely by
    ``cfg.events_replay``. The live-loop body, the listener
    registration, the ``ws_closed`` exit, the disconnect detection,
    and the SSE-connect/disconnect metric recording are uniform.

    Pre-lift behaviour preserved on both kinds with two small
    convergence wins:

    - **Coord gains SSE connect/disconnect metrics.** Pre-lift coord
      did no metric recording on its events stream; the lifted body
      always calls ``metrics.record_sse_connect()`` / ``...disconnect()``,
      which gives the cluster dashboard the same per-stream
      observability interactive's had since 1.0.
    - **Both kinds now check ``request.is_disconnected()`` between
      polls AND the ``ws_closed`` event.** Pre-lift interactive
      relied solely on ``ws_closed`` to terminate (which never fires
      if the client just goes away without a proper close); pre-lift
      coord relied solely on ``is_disconnected``. The lifted body
      uses both — whichever fires first wins.

def make_create_handler(
    cfg: SessionEndpointConfig,
    *,
    audit_emit: CreateAuditEmitter | None = None,
) -> Handler:
    """Lifted body for ``POST {prefix}/new`` — workstream creation.

    Both kinds share the create sequence (parse body → resolve uid
    → kind-specific validate → resolve skill → ``mgr.create`` (with
    ``defer_emit_created=True``) → save attachments → ``mgr.discard``
    on validation failure / ``mgr.commit_create`` on success → audit
    → kind-specific post-install → respond). Per-kind divergence
    captured by the cfg + ``audit_emit``:

    - ``cfg.create_supports_attachments`` — when ``True``, the body
      may arrive as ``multipart/form-data`` with a ``meta`` JSON
      field + ``file`` parts; uploads are validated post-create and
      the workstream is rolled back if any file fails (interactive's
      pre-lift pattern, lifted to coord here for parity).
    - ``cfg.create_supports_user_id_override`` — when ``True``, a
      ``user_id`` body field overrides the auth-derived uid if the
      auth token is from a trusted service. Interactive ``True`` so
      console-proxied creates carry the real end-user identity;
      coord ``False``.
    - ``cfg.create_validate_request`` — kind-specific pre-create
      gates (interactive: ws_id format, kind, parent_ws_id ownership,
      attachments+resume_ws combo; coord: 401-on-empty-uid).
    - ``cfg.create_build_kwargs`` — kind-specific kwargs for
      ``mgr.create``. Required when the kind mounts a create handler.
    - ``cfg.create_post_install`` — kind-specific tail end (e.g.
      interactive's resume + skill_config + initial-message worker
      thread; coord's initial_message via coord_adapter.send).
    - ``audit_emit`` — ``workstream.created`` on interactive,
      ``coordinator.create`` on coord.

    Ordering invariants (load-bearing — easy to break in a refactor):

    1. ``mgr.create(defer_emit_created=True)`` runs FIRST so the
       slot + storage row + session exist before any post-create
       work touches them.
    2. Attachment validation runs BEFORE ``commit_create`` so a
       rejected upload produces zero lifecycle events. Failure path
       is ``mgr.discard`` + ``delete_workstream``; success path
       falls through.
    3. ``mgr.commit_create(ws)`` runs BEFORE ``audit_emit`` and
       ``post_install`` so any state-change events ``post_install``
       triggers (e.g. a worker dispatched on ``initial_message``)
       reach the cluster collector for an already-known ws_id.
       Reordering this commit after the worker dispatch puts
       ``emit_state`` on the wire ahead of ``emit_created``.

    Behavior changes vs the pre-lift handlers (documented in
    CHANGELOG, mostly coord-up-to-interactive parity gains):

    - **Coord gains create-time attachments.** Pre-lift
      ``coordinator_create`` accepted JSON only and ignored uploads;
      the lifted body parses multipart bodies on coord and saves
      attachments through the kind-agnostic storage layer (§ Post-P3
      reckoning item #1). When the same request supplies an
      ``initial_message``, the uploads are reserved onto the
      dispatched first turn via ``CoordinatorAdapter.send`` (which
      gained ``attachments`` + ``send_id`` kwargs in the same
      release).
    - **No phantom create→close pair on coord rollback.** The lifted
      body now passes ``defer_emit_created=True`` to ``mgr.create``
      and explicitly fires ``mgr.commit_create(ws)`` only after
      attachment validation passes. On failure ``mgr.discard(ws.id)``
      releases the slot WITHOUT firing ``emit_closed`` (because the
      create was never advertised). Pre-fix, coord's ``mgr.create``
      fired ``emit_created`` synchronously and a rollback then
      called ``mgr.close``, surfacing a quick create→close pair on
      the cluster events stream that consumers had to reconcile via
      the collector's diff path. Post-fix, a rejected upload
      produces zero events. Interactive's ``emit_created`` is a
      documented no-op stub so the deferral is observably a no-op
      there; the ``ws_created`` broadcast on the global SSE queue
      continues to fire from the kind's post_install callback.
    - **Coord gains the disabled-skill rejection.** Pre-lift
      ``coordinator_create`` silently allowed disabled skills to
      flow through to ``mgr.create``; the lifted body returns 400
      ("Skill not found or disabled") matching interactive's
      behaviour. Disabled skills are inert by definition; the gate
      makes that explicit.
    - **Both kinds converge on 200 OK.** Pre-lift interactive
      returned 200 (default); coord returned 201. SDK consumers
      that were branching on ``response.status == 201`` on coord
      should switch to ``response.ok``. 200 was picked over 201 for
      response-shape parity with the rest of the v1 surface (every
      other shared verb returns 200), at the cost of leaving REST-
      strictly-correct semantics on the table — a one-time release
      note rather than ongoing client churn.
    - **Both kinds converge on the manager-at-capacity 429
      semantic.** Pre-lift interactive translated mgr.create's
      ``RuntimeError`` to 400 ("invalid create request"); coord
      already translated to 429. RuntimeError on ``SessionManager.create``
      is documented as "manager at capacity" — 429 (rate-limit /
      try-later) is the correct shape for both.
    - **Both kinds converge on the factory-misconfig 503
      semantic.** Pre-lift interactive let ``ValueError`` (raised by
      the session factory on a misconfigured model alias) propagate
      as 500; coord already translated to 503. The lifted body uses
      503 with the factory's remediation text on both kinds —
      operators get the actionable message instead of a generic
      stack-traced 500.
    - **Both kinds get a correlation_id'd 500 on unexpected
      ``mgr.create`` failure.** Pre-lift interactive let unexpected
      exceptions propagate as 500 with a stack-traced response
      (potential information leak); coord already returned a
      correlation_id'd 500 with the message redacted. The lifted
      body adopts coord's safer pattern on both kinds.
    - **Audit-emit failures no longer 500.** Pre-lift interactive
      audit failures surfaced as HTTP 500 (no try/except); coord
      swallowed via try/except + log.debug. The lifted body wraps
      ``audit_emit`` in try/except + ``warning`` log, returning the
      successful 200 to the caller. Mirrors the close / cancel /
      open lift contracts.
    - **Always-include response shape.** The lifted body always
      returns ``{ws_id, name, resumed, message_count, attachment_ids}``,
      with the parity fields defaulting to ``False`` / ``0`` / ``[]``
      on kinds whose post-install doesn't populate them. SDK
      consumers don't branch on kind.

    Both kinds share the listing sequence (auth → manager lookup →

    divergence captured by:

    - ``cfg.permission_gate`` — coord's ``admin.coordinator`` check;
      interactive ``None`` (auth middleware covers it).
    - ``cfg.manager_lookup`` — already used by every other lifted
      verb.
    - ``cfg.list_resolve_titles`` — interactive's bulk user-alias
      lookup; coord ``None``. Single ``SELECT ... WHERE ws_id IN
      (...)`` resolves every active row's title in one storage
      round-trip (replaces the pre-lift per-row N+1).

    Always-include row shape: ``{ws_id, name, state, kind,
    parent_ws_id, user_id}``. SDK consumers don't branch on kind.

    Behaviour changes vs the pre-lift handlers (documented in
    CHANGELOG):

    - **Top-level response key converges on ``"workstreams"``.**
      Pre-lift coord returned ``{"coordinators": [...]}``; the lifted
      body returns ``{"workstreams": [...]}`` for response-shape
      parity with interactive. Coord SDK / frontend consumers
      branching on ``data.coordinators`` swap to ``data.workstreams``.
    - **Interactive row key renames ``"id"`` → ``"ws_id"``.** Pre-
      lift interactive used the bare ``id`` field while every other
      shared verb on this surface (cancel, open, events, create,
      saved-list) uses ``ws_id``. Convergence eliminates the
      internal inconsistency. Frontend consumers reading
      ``ws.id`` from the active-list response swap to ``ws.ws_id``.
    - **Always-include row fields.** ``user_id`` was coord-only;
      ``kind`` + ``parent_ws_id`` were interactive-only. Both
      kinds now populate all three. ``parent_ws_id`` defaults to
      ``None`` for coord (coordinators have no parent).
    - **Storage / manager-lock work moved off the event loop.**
      ``mgr.list_all()`` acquires the manager mutex; the title
      resolution may dip into storage for the alias lookup. Both
      now run via ``asyncio.to_thread`` (matching coord's pre-
      existing perf-2 pattern from the saved-coordinators review).

    Per-kind divergence:

    - ``cfg.permission_gate`` — coord's ``admin.coordinator`` check.
    - ``cfg.list_kind`` — required ``WorkstreamKind`` passed straight

      surfaces 500 with a clear log line — fails loud rather than
      silently filtering for the wrong kind. Distinct from
      ``audit_action_prefix`` (audit-action namespacing) so adding a
      third kind doesn't have to overload the audit prefix as a
      kind classifier.
    - ``cfg.saved_state_filter`` — coord wires ``"closed"`` so only
      explicitly-closed coordinators surface; interactive wires
      ``None`` (any state except the tombstoned ``deleted`` rows the

    """Lifted body for ``GET {prefix}/{ws_id}`` — workstream display fields.

    Returns ``{ws_id, name, state, user_id, kind}`` for the workstream.
    Lazy-rehydrates on miss via ``mgr.open(ws_id)`` so a closed/evicted
    workstream comes back into memory before the response. Mirrors the
    error-handling pattern from :func:`make_open_handler`: ``ValueError``
    from the session factory surfaces as 503 with the factory's
    remediation text; any other rehydrate failure surfaces as a
    correlation-id'd 500 with the per-kind noun in the user-facing
    message.

    Cross-kind isolation is enforced inside ``mgr.open()`` itself —
    it returns ``None`` for missing rows, kind mismatches, and
    tombstoned rows; all surface as 404 with ``cfg.not_found_label``.
    No inline storage check needed (unlike :func:`make_history_handler`)
    because rehydrate is the existence proof.

    Per-kind divergence:

    - ``cfg.permission_gate`` — coord's ``admin.coordinator`` check;
      interactive ``None``.
    - ``cfg.manager_lookup`` — already used by every other lifted verb.
    - ``cfg.not_found_label`` — per-kind 404 wording.
    - ``cfg.audit_action_prefix`` — per-kind noun in the 500 error.

    Pre-lift coord behaviour preserved verbatim. The lift adds the
    endpoint to interactive as a feature gain — pre-lift interactive
    had no HTTP detail endpoint (SDK consumers had to subscribe to
    SSE just to read display fields).

def make_send_handler(cfg: SessionEndpointConfig) -> Handler:
    """Lifted body for ``POST {prefix}/{ws_id}/send`` — message dispatch.

    Reserves any attachment ids the request carries, captures a
    ``send_id`` token for end-to-end tracking, then dispatches via
    :func:`turnstone.core.session_worker.send` (atomic
    spawn-or-enqueue under ``ws._lock``). Both queue-reuse and
    spawn paths reserve so the eventual ``mark_attachments_consumed``
    can match on ``reserved_for_msg_id``.

    Capability flags on ``cfg`` toggle the kind-specific behaviour:

    - ``supports_attachments``: when ``False``, the entire
      attachment-resolution block (reservation, fetch, scope-check)
      short-circuits and any ``attachment_ids`` in the body are
      silently ignored — no reservation, no error. Both kinds wire
      ``True`` post-P1.5; the flag exists so a kind that hasn't
      lit up its UI surface yet can defer.
    - ``spawn_metrics``: when set, fires once on the spawn path with
      ``(request, ui)``. Interactive wires its WebUI per-conversation
      counters here; coord wires ``None``.
    - ``emit_message_queued``: when ``True``, the queue-reuse path
      pushes a ``message_queued`` event onto the listener queue.

    Response shape (both kinds, P1.5 onwards). Every successful
    response carries ``attached_ids`` and ``dropped_attachment_ids``
    (empty lists when no attachments are involved), so SDK
    consumers don't have to branch on whether the request had
    attachments:

    - 200 ``{"status": "ok", "attached_ids", "dropped_attachment_ids"}``
      — fresh worker spawned. ``attached_ids`` is the subset of
      requested attachments that landed (may be a strict subset on
      reservation race losses).
    - 200 ``{"status": "queued", "priority", "msg_id", "attached_ids",
      "dropped_attachment_ids"}`` — reused live worker; queued for
      injection at the next tool-result seam.
    - 200 ``{"status": "queue_full", "attached_ids",
      "dropped_attachment_ids"}`` — live worker's queue at
      capacity; reservations released. Caller should retry. The
      ``attached_ids`` list is always empty here (the dispatch
      didn't take ownership of any reservations).
    - 4xx / 500 — auth / not-found / no-session per the usual
      :class:`SessionEndpointConfig` semantics.
