"""CoordinatorAdapter — SessionManager bridge for coordinator workstreams.

Emits lifecycle events via the ``ClusterCollector``'s console pseudo-node
fan-out. ``cleanup_ui`` ports the listener-queue + approval/plan event
unblocks from the old ``CoordinatorManager._cleanup`` path. Also hosts
the children-registry and cluster-event fan-out thread — these are
coord-specific concerns the shared :class:`SessionManager` doesn't know
about, so they live here rather than polluting the manager's surface.

The adapter takes a late-bound reference to its owning manager via
:meth:`attach` (called right after the manager is constructed). Some
paths need ``manager.get(ws_id)`` to read a live coordinator's user_id
for the storage-seeded children rebuild.
